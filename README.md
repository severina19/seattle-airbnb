### Motivation
In this project, I used the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) process to examine the Seatle AirBnb dataset from Kaggle, to try to find answers to the following questions:

1. What are the key factors which influence the price of a listing?
2. How is customer rating related to the price?
3. What are the 5 most expensive zipcodes in boston? And where are the cheapest place to stay in boston? 



### Installtion
This project is developed in Python 3.7, and the libraries needed include:
- pandas 0.22.0
- numpy 1.15.4
- matplotlib 2.1.1
